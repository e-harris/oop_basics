## Class
Is like a cookie cutter, that creates instances of cookies.

They wrappers to define how an object looks and behaves.

Classes will wrap **characteristics as attributes** and **behaviours as methods.**


## Methods vs Functions
Methods are functions that belong to a specific data type.

Where functions are anyomous  and anything can call and run them

Where as **Methods NEED the instance to be called**

## Characteristics/ how and object looks like
These are attributes assigned to each instance
They are variables assigned to an object / instance

## Instance
Occurance of something


## Self
Refers to the instance in which the method is being called.

self.name = 'ringo'

This means the specific object attribute name will have the string 'ringo'

## Abstraction


## Encapsulation


## Inheritance


## Polymorphism
